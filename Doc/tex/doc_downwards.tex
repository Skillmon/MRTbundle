\chapter{Downwards Incompatibilities}
Though I try to avoid it as much as possible, there might sometimes be a
backwards incompatibility, which is necessary to implement new features I deem
worth it or fix bugs. Where possible I'll try to provide means to switch back to
something close to the old behaviour.

This chapter should list all those ground breaking changes (which might be
really minor, though).

\section{\pkg{MRTtab}}
\begin{incompatibilities}{\pkg{MRTtab}}
  2019-02-09 & v0.0.5 & \cs{MRTcline} & By default the entire line is coloured
  first and then the effects of \cs{MRTcline} are applied. Reversible with the
  \opt{cline version} key (see \autoref{sec:tab:options:setup}). \\
\end{incompatibilities}
