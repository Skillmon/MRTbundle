\chapter{Introduction}
This bundle provides three \LaTeX\ classes, one for theses and one for
presentations, which both aim to match the corresponding MS Office templates of
the Chair of Measurement and Control Engineering (Lehrstuhl f√ºr Mess"~~und
Regeltechnik; MRT) of the University of Bayreuth, hence the name. Along the two
major classes \cls{MRTthesis} and \cls{MRTbeam} there are another class to
create stand alone images and minor auxiliary packages contained in this
distribution.

The classes are originally created for use with \hologo{pdfLaTeX} and give the
best results with it. This is caused by the available fonts. The classes were
created for use with the \pkg{helvet} font which is not a good choice for
\luaxelatex*. Therefore, if you're using those engines, you'll be encouraged to
choose a system font matching Helvetica or Arial.

This bundle makes no claim to be complete, comprehensive, or correct. For
formatting errors I don't take any responsibility. Each author takes full
liability for his work and its formatting.

You're allowed to share this work with fellow students working at the MRT,
though official distribution channels might be better suited as they assure up
to date versions.

I'd feel guilty distributing this bundle without saying the following: I'm not
responsible for the overall look of this. I tried to match the Word template of
the institution where possible and as a result, this is non-optimal typography,
in my humble opinion.

Of course this documentation is created with one of the provided classes, namely
\cls{MRTthesis}, in use.

If you're not yet familiar with \LaTeX\ you should stop reading at this point
(meaning the end of this paragraph) and either read a \emph{good} and
\emph{up-to-date} introduction to \LaTeX\ and afterwards read on or use MS Word
for your thesis. Personally I think the time reading an introduction in order to
use \LaTeX\ is well spend, but there certainly are different opinions on that --
unfortunately opinions are prone to be biased, mine is no exception. A viable
introduction is lshort which is available in several languages at the following
