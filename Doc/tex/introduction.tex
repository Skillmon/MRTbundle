\chapter{Introduction}
This bundle provides two \LaTeX\ classes, one for theses and one for
presentations, which both aim to match the corresponding MS Office templates of
the institute Lehrstuhl f√ºr Mess- und Regeltechnik (MRT) of the University of
Bayreuth, hence the name. Along the two major classes \cls{MRTthesis} and
\cls{MRTbeam} there are minor auxiliary packages in this distribution contained.

This bundle makes no claim to be complete, comprehensive, or correct. For
formatting errors I don't take any responsibility. Each author takes full
liability for his work and its formatting.

You're allowed to share this work with fellow students working at the MRT

I feel guilty distributing this bundle without saying the following: I'm not
responsible for the overall look of this. I tried to match the Word template of
the institution where possible and as a result, this is non-optimal typography.

Of course this documentation is created with one of the provided classes, namely
\cls{MRTthesis}, in use.
